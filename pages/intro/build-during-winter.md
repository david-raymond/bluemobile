We got our bare van on December 15, 2017. In Quebec, December is winter time, and particularly this year, it has been pretty cold since then, as low as -20 C/-4 F at some point (we are writing this on January 7, 2018). The van does not fit in our garage, so any work on it must be done outside.

Note that this is about building the camper van during cold weather, not about build a camper van to be used in cold weather. Although the camper van will be reasonably well insulated, no efforts have been made to make it a winter camper van.

We tried to find a shop we could rent. But for various reasons, this did not work out:

- There are some DIY garages in and around Montreal where you can do work on your car, but they are around 30 km from our place and aside from the logistics of having to carry a bunch of tools and material from our house, we could easily imagine missing a tool or something available in the house
- We did not purchase winter tires for the van since it will not initially be used during winter, and winter tires are required by law in Quebec between December 15 and March 15 (although we could probably have avoided any problem for short distances)
- We have some friends who work in the industrial area of the city where we live and have shops with high garage doors, but their workshop was not available for such use

So, we have to deal with the cold weather, and accept the fact that build progress would be significantly slowed down during the cold period.

One thing we did to help is install a temporary regular residential baseboard heater in the van, which we connected directly to an unused breaker in the house electrical panel in the garage. This helps, but not much when it is very cold, especially with a bare metal shell.

On some occasions, we started the gas engine of the van and maxed out the heater. This works better and manages to warm up the upper half of the van, close to the ceiling. But still working in the cold between the garage and the van is not ideal, and the floor remains cold.

The thing is that many initial steps in the build process involve gluing:

- Soundproofing membrane glued to van walls and ceiling (self-adhesive)
- Insulation panels glued to van walls and ceiling using construction and spray adhesive
- Lumbers glued to floor using construction adhesive
- Spray foam for sealing gaps around insulation panels

(You can lean more about the specifics of the build in other sections.)

Not only are adhesives generally not effective in the cold, but cold metal forms condensation and frost when the interior is heated, which is even worse.

We were still able to successfully perform some gluing steps by taking advantage of the sun. The van being blue helps absorb the sun's energy and the side of the van, and to some extent the roof, exposed to the sun (a few hours a day as days are much shorter in the winter) was warm enough to eliminate condensation (but the soundproofing adhesive, construction glue and spray adhesive still had to be warmed up on top of the baseboard heater and with a hair dryer before use...)

Unfortunately, the gluing on the floor had to be postponed to warmer days since the sun cannot help heat the floor and heat generated with the heater or engine raises up to the ceiling. And the construction adhesive used on the floor had to be at its strongest since it is used for securing lumber to the floor for eventually anchoring cabinets with large wood anchors (to avoiding drilling holes in the floor).

Of course during cold weather, some work other than gluing could still be done in the van, such as cutting cardboard templates for various panel shapes. And some work could also be done in the garage, such as cutting those panels to shape according to the cardboard templates.
