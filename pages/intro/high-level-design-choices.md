Before delving into the [build details](build-overview.html), it may be helpful to understand the high-level design choices we made about our future camper van.

Designed for 2 persons
----------------------

This camper van is simply not designed for a family. We have 2 children and we camped in a popup trailer and later in a regular travel trailer many years with them. But this camper van is for us, 2 persons only. Our children may borrow it, but we will not travel with more than 2 persons in the camper van.

Stealthiness
------------

We do not want our camper van to look too much like a camper van. We want it to be as discreet as possible so that it does not look too much out of place if ever we stop for the night outside of a campground.

Emphasis on electricity
-----------------------

Incorporating propane into a custom built camper van involves many considerations,

A propane tank can be installed horizontally under the vehicle. The tank has to be designed for horizontal use. This setup has the following drawbacks:

- The tank is more exposed to road hazards
- The tank is more exposed to dirt, water and salt and is thus prone to corrosion
- The tank, which cannot be removed, is harder to access and must be refilled at more specialized places (not at your regular BBQ propane tank fillup station)

A propane tank can be installed inside the vehicle. This setup has the following drawbacks:

- The compartment must be sealed from the inside and properly vented, generally by having an unstealthy vented access door from the outside
- The propane tank takes space (batteries too, but we want batteries anyways)

For these reasons, we decided to forgo propane altogether, and put an emphasis on electricity. Therefore, no need for propane installation certification and no risks of leaks and explosion.

Our camping experience, especially during our road trip in the American West which was the main [trigger](intro-inception.html) for this project, is that cooking with a small electric burner is very convenient and effective. That is why we nearly always take camping spots which have electricity. And for those times when we are not connected to the grid, we can get along with some short cooking periods on batteries (with an inverter), or eat stuff which does not require cooking.

Of course, without propane, running hot water is pretty much out of the question. We can't have everything! Anyways, we also decided to not have a shower (see [No fixed shower and toilet](#no-fixed-shower-toilet)). But of course, we can heat water in an electric kettle if hot water is needed, for the dishes for example.

So batteries, a solar charging system and an inverter are required. Anyways, for me this is a fun part in itself! 

Also, not having propane excludes having a fixed heater (more space saved). The plan here is to not do camping in cold weather, and have a small low noise portable electric heater connected to the grid for those colder nights.

No fixed shower and toilet
--------------------------

A shower-toilet combo, no mater how small, takes a lots of space in a small camper van. Especially if we include the propane tank and water heater.

Most campgrounds in North America have nice showers so the lack of a shower in the camper van is not a problem for us.

We therefore decided to forgo the shower altogether and save the space for other uses (see [Fixed bed](#fixed-bed)). Also, this agrees with the fact that we will not have propane either.

As far as the toilet is concerned, not having one makes you too dependent on external toilets. But a portable toilet is an entirely workable solution which we chose.

Fixed bed
---------

We are somewhat lazy, especially on vacation. Even at home we often neglect to make the bed. So having a multipurpose area that can convert between a sleeping area and a dinette/living room is pretty much a turn off for us.

We want a fixed sleeping area. For us, space used for that purpose is better than space used for a shower-toilet combo, for example.

Following some Internet research and looking at many custom camper van builds, it quickly became clear we wanted a fixed sleepint area at the rear of the vehicle. And since we are rather short persons, we would be sleeping sideways on a full size bed, which would extend around 54" towards the front of the vehicle.

The bed platform would be elevated to leave ample storage space underneath, but just low enough so that we can sit straight on the bed and not hit the ceiling with our heads. That area is therefore also a comfy place to relax, watch a movie, plan for the next day, etc.

No traditional dinette area
---------------------------

A dinette area requires a bench or some kind of seats. The vehicule already has seats and if we make them swivel and orient them towards the back of the vehicule, we can use them for anything which requires seating, including eating. We simply require an effective table system, the details of which are not known as of now.

Large refrigerator-freezer
--------------------------

We like eating well, and like not being too restricted on refrigerator and freezer space for food and drinks. We spent a lot of time researching the various options among the efficient compressor-based 12V-only models (since we do not have propane). And we settled on the <a href="http://www.novakool.com/products/two_doors/rfu6200_6800_8000_9000.htm" target="_blank">Nova Kool RFU6200</a> (the one at the top of the page).

We are really eager to do a road trip with that fridge. This is one of the major purchase and we think we will like it a lot.

Storage
-------

We want to have reasonable storage space in the vehicle. Storage for:

- Clothes (not left in bags!), coats, shoes, boots
- Food and drinks
- Cookware
- Small appliances
- Camping gear
- Tools
- Electronics
- Etc.

We believe the other choices we made will allow us to have ample storage space.

Modular design
--------------

The idea to make the build [modular](intro-modular-build.html) came on later during our planning. We were analyzing various ways to build the camper van, mostly the cabinets. And although the details are not known as of now, we are aiming for custom-made independent cabinets, similar to modern kitchen cabinets. And if appropriate considerations are taken, the cabinets (and the bed platform) and the way to solidly anchor them to the vehicle (floor and walls) can be designed so that they are easily removable.

The idea is that when not used as a camper van, the vehicle could also be used as:

- A cargo van for transporting various large and/or numerous items (renovation materials, moving)
- A family vehicle with ample "trunk" space (ski trip)

So we included modularity as a high-level design choice, and included the option of having a removable 2nd row bench seat, to make it usable as a 5-person vehicle. This bench seat would not be used in camper mode.

Weight reduction
----------------

We do not want the camper van to be too heavy in order to optimize gas mileage and improve handling.

As of now, we do not know to what extent weight conscious choices will really make a significant difference down the road. But still, we tried the best we reasonably can to avoid useless weight. For example:

- Using 1/2" plywood instead of 5/8" or 3/4" and accepting some "springiness" in the various panels
- Not having fixed water tanks (black: no need since no fixed toilet, gray: not a lot of waster water since no shower, clear: no need for a large tank for only 2 people and without a fixed shower)
- No propane tank, no water heater, no space heater
- No heavy finishing materials (no hardwood floring or wood plank ceeling, no marble or granite counter, etc.)

Of course, going electric requires heavy batteries. Granted, lighium ion batteries exist for the RV industry, but we felt they were too expensive and went for the regular "golf cart" type of battery. And they are heavey. We can't have everything! 

Target price for the conversion
-------------------------------

We estimated that the conversion would cost us between 10K and 20K $ CAD on top of the base vehicle price. We are working hard to keep it within that range.

We are currently hovering at around 15K $ CAD and hope to remain close to this until the end of the conversion.

Of course, we are talking only about parts and materials here. We are not talking about time which is not factored in. Building the camper van is considered part of the fun in this project and time is not accounted for as an investment.
