One important feature of our build is the fact that it has a modular design in order to have a multipurpose vehicle:

- Camper van (of course...) for 2 persons
- Family vehicle for 5 persons with ample "trunk" volume
- Roomy cargo van

These configurations are mutually exclusive as they require removing and adding components.

Camper van
----------

- Bed platform:
  - About 30" above the floor
  - Made up of 3 boards over driver-side division, center and power center cabinet (see other layouts)
  - Sleeps sideways (we are rather short persons)
  - Width of a full (double) bed: 54"
  - Approximately 6' long from head to toes
- Under bed storage accessible from the rear (left of bed)
- Rear storage is on 36" drawer floor slide which extends outside
- Under bed storage accessible from inside (right of bed)
- Upper cabinets close to ceiling and above sleepers' feet
- Outside folding table attached to galley so that height from ground as a regular table
- [No fixed shower and toilet](intro-high-level-design-choices.html#no-fixed-shower-toilet)
