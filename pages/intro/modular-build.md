One important feature of our build is the fact that it has a modular design in order to have a multipurpose vehicle:

- Camper van (of course...) for 2 persons
- Family vehicle for 5 persons with ample "trunk" volume
- Roomy cargo van

These configurations are mutually exclusive as they require removing and adding components.

Camper van
----------

- Bed platform is about 30" above the floor
- Bed platform made up of 3 boards over driver-side division, center and power center cabinet (see other layouts)
- Bed platform sleeps sideways (we are rather short persons)
- Under bed storage accessible from the rear (left of bed)
- Rear storage is on 36" drawer floor slide which extends outside
- Under bed storage accessible from inside (right bed)
- Upper cabinets close to ceeling and above sleepers' feet
- Outside folding table attached to galley so that height from ground comfortable
- [No fixed shower and toilet](intro-high-level-design-choices.html#no-fixed-shower-toilet)  
  
Family vehicle

- Division and power center cabinet under bed platform not removable
