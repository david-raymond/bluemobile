Probably the most important decision for this project is the choice of the base vehicle, its physical and mechanical configuration and its options.

Note that our decision was to purchase a new vehicle (see [inception](intro-inception.html)).

Base vehicle
------------

Given that we wanted to be able to stand up in the van and were not really keen on having a fiberglass roof extension, our choices were pretty much limited to those vehicles available with a high roof:

- Dodge RAM Promaster
- Ford Transit
- Mercedes-Benz Sprinter
- Nissan NV Cargo

It did not take too long to go for the Promaster based on these arguments:

- Front-wheel drive so more room under the floor for adding water tanks or other motorhome equipment
- Supposedly smaller turning radius than the others
- Roadtrek uses this base vehicle for many of its camper vans, so it must have its merits
- Sprinter is more expensive (which probably accounts for higher build quality)  
- Promaster has a rather square box facilitating the camper van conversion
- NV Cargo is not a popular choice among camper van converters
- Promaster has a nice active forum (see this <a href="http://www.promasterforum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=56586" target="_blank">thread</a> in particular)
- Parts are readily available and reasonably priced

We are not saying that the Promaster is the obvious choice. Other base vehicles have their own merits, and many will have arguments in favor of other vehicles. This is the decision we came up with based on our needs and what we knew at the time. We hope time will us right.

Physical configuration
----------------------

We wanted a high roof, so we basically had to choose between:

- 1500 136" wheelbase
- 2500 136" wheelbase
- 2500 159" wheelbase
- 3500 159" wheelbase
- 3500 159" wheelbase extended 

Initially I wanted a shorter vehicle for better urban maneuverability, but Dominique convinced me it would be too small to be comfortable. So 159" wheelbase was the choice, but no need for the extended version. So the choice was really between the 2500 and 3500 159" wheelbase. We went for the 2500 and think we made the right choice.

We did not care about the "window van" version as our plans included tall and upper cabinets.  

Options
-------

Among the options offered by the manufacturer and listed on <a href="https://www.ramtruck.ca" target="_blank">www.ramtruck.ca</a>, we wanted the following:

- Blue color
- Interior convenience group (mostly for the shelf above the roof trim)
- Premium appearance group (fogs and chrome grille, mostly for the looks)
- Hitch (mostly to carry bikes; manufacturer price seems right and aftermarket hitches do not seem worth the trouble)
- Mud guards
- Windows on the rear doors (cheaper from the manufacturer than aftermarket windows)
- Leather-wrapped steering wheel (for a somewhat luxury feel)
- Alloy wheels

But other options are also available when ordering at the dealership, among which we wanted those:

- Driver and passenger swivel seats (aftermarket swivel plates raise the height of the seats which is unacceptable since we are rather short persons)
- Cruise control (who does not want cruise control in 2018?)
- 2 additional key fobs

In august 2017 when we were ready to purchase the vehicle, such a combination of options was not available on the market. If we have accepted the white color, we may have been able to find one which could have gotten close and make the idea of getting the vehicle sooner compelling enough to go for a 2017 model, but white was out of the question. So a 2018 model it would be.

Some surprises and deceptions
-----------------------------

When receiving the vehicle on December 15, 2017, we realized the following:

### Rearview camera

When ordering, we though that the "Park-Sense rear park assist system" was the rearview camera, but at 425 $ CAD we thought we would simply install an aftermarket model. In fact, the initial plan was to replace the whole radio unit with an aftermarket one combining radio, navigation and rearview camera into a single unit with a larger screen than the one provided by the manufacturer. But the vehicle does have rearview camera. A gift or a misunderstanding from our part? Probably the latter. Anyways, the presence of the rearview camera will likely postpone any decision regarding a new radio unit.

### Electric mirrors

There is an option caller "Power folding, heated exterior mirrors". We do not really have a need for such an option. However, I expected that the base mirrors would at least be electrically adjustable, but they are not. We dot not know if this option implies that the mirrors are electrically adjustable (on top of being electrically foldable). Anyways, not a show stopper.

### 4 key fobs

The sales representative insisted that commercial vehicles come with only 1 key fob and that they always include the option for the 2 additional key fobs.

But when we received the vehicle, 4 key fobs were included! I had therefore paid 150 $ CAD too much since 2 key fobs are sufficient for us. The sales representative said he was surprised to have a total of 4 key fobs. I guess I will just have spare batteries for my main 2 key fobs...
