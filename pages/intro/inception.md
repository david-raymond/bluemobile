Our road trip in the American West
----------------------------------

The project started around July 2017 when me and my wife were reflecting on our road trip in the fall of 2016 in the American West (Grand Canyon, etc.) with a small rental van from <a href="https://www.escapecampervans.com" target="_blank">Escape CamperVans</a>.

Although this rental van was pretty small and limited in terms of amenities, we absolutely loved the fact that it was both our everyday vehicle and home. Anywhere we would go, it would come with us.

Feel like stopping by Wallmart to purchase some food? And decide to stick around in the city for a few more hours enjoy its charm? No problem! The food is in the solar/battery-powered fridge.

Decide to change plans and leave for another far-away place late in the evening? No problem! We can stop in a rest area or in many other places along the way to sleep before continuing our journey.

We need a camper van and want to build it
-----------------------------------------

So we concluded that owning our own camper van and doing other road trips across Canada and USA (and who knows, maybe even further...) would be something we would really enjoy.

But camper vans such as Roadtreks, Safari Condos, Winnebagos and New-Wests (to name those which are more available in Quebec) can be expensive, 100K $ CAD and up (all inclusive). Of course, this is for new vehicles. Used ones can be much cheaper. But be it justified or not, we are worried about problems we may get with a used vehicle because of age or improper maintenance.

Also, we pretty well know what we like and don't like in camping vehicles (trailer or motor home), and the idea of building one to our needs is compelling (its inside house section at least).

So I convinced my wife that starting with a bare commercial van (with some useful basic options for a camper van), we should be able to build something entirely suitable for our needs with an additional investment of between 10K and 20K $ CAD, all-inclusive. This brings the total cost down by a fair amount compared to a new camper van, on top of providing something that is custom made for our needs.

The time and effort argument
----------------------------

We already hear some of you thinking "but what about the time and effort" required for such a project. Of course, if we factor this in and evaluate its cost based on some hourly rate, we are at lost. Thinking, planing, researching, designing, purchasing the right components at the right price, building, making mistakes, rethinking, etc., take a lot of time. For such a project, this time must somehow be considered some kind of leisure/fun time otherwise, it does not make sense financially. But we do have some free time, and we went for it.

We did not compile the the time spent up to when the actual build started. We would very roughly estimate this time at around 500 hours (average of 3 hours a day between July and December, including "dreaming" time before going to sleep).

We are however compiling our time in the building phase which started toward the end of December 2017, when we got the van.

Ordering and receiving the bare van
-----------------------------------

It was in August of 2017 we committed to the project and got ready to shop for the bare van. We selected the [Dodge RAM Promaster high roof 159" wheelbase](intro-promaster.html) as the bare van. But in August, new custom-ordered current-year vehicles were not available anymore. Most existing vehicles were white in color which we wanted to avoid since in our opinion it looks too much like a commercial van. And those few which were not white (we had a few colors which could would have suited us) did not have the options we wanted.

So we went with custom-ordering a 2018 model (ordering had just been open for 2018 models). The problem here was that the generous manufacturer rebate of 5K $ CAD advertised in August was obviously not applicable for 2018 models.

So the sales director at <a href="https://www.champlaindodgechrysler.com" target="_blank">Champlain Dodge Chrysler</a> in Verdun, Daria Grzeszczakowski (she changed position since then), was very kind in placing the order, but not concluding the sales immediately, hoping that by the time the van is delivered, the manufacturer has incentives offered for 2018 models. In fact, she explained that she could not have done it othewise anyways since sales cannot be concluded for vehicles that are not yet "taken" by some dealership. Anyways, we had a vehicle ordered, but no guarantee it was for us. We simply trusted Daria on this matter (and of course were right in doing so).

The months passed. We were really hoping for something like a 2-month delay for the production and transport of the van so that we could start working on it in October 2017, when there are still many warm days. You guessed this is not what happened. The van was delivered in December 2017 and was in our driveway on December 15. Fortunately, the manufacturer incentives were similar to those in August for 2017 models (4.5K $ CAD total). But unfortunately, December is [winter](intro-build-during-winter.html) in Quebec, and this year, the second half of December has been pretty cold, which is not ideal for working on a camper van conversion. We do have a garage, but obviously a high roof va does not fit.
