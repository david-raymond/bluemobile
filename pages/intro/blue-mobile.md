This site is all about our camper van conversion build, which we named "Blue Mobile".

Let's see if the following teases you a bit:

- Brand new 2018 [Promaster](intro-promaster.html) high-roof 159" wheelbase
- [Modular](intro-modular-build.html) design (multipurpose vehicle)
- Designed for 2 persons with fixed bed and lots of storage when in camper mode
- Usable as a family vehicle for 5 persons with ample "trunk" volume
- Usable as a roomy cargo van when interior amenities removed
- Emphasis on electricity (no fixed propane)
- Balance between finishing quality and build effort/time
- [Basic tools](misc-basic-tools.html) and skills required (we are no expert woodworkers...)
- Most of the build done during Canadian cold [winter](intro-build-during-winter.html)

If you are dreaming of building your own camper van as we did before undertaking this project..

If you are building one and want to compare, share or get ideas, as we did from other camper van builders...

Or if you have already built one and feel like sharing your opinions...

Do not hesitate to read and comment!

Our motivation for writing about our project here is simply to share with however finds this information useful. We extensively and freely fed ourselves with information and advice from other camper van build sites (and other more general sites), and feel we ought to give something back.

Of course, we also are somewhat proud of this project... <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

Who we are
----------

We are David and Dominique, a middle aged French-Canadian couple living in Montreal, Quebec (this site is in English simply for reaching a greater audience). We have 2 children in their early adulthood. Younger, they have often traveled with us, but this project is mostly for us, not the whole family. We also have a 10 year-old Fox Terrier, who may accompany us on some or our future road trips.

We like to travel and have visited a reasonable number of places in the world (all-inclusive resorts, cruises, trips in remote countries, camping).

The 2-week road trip we did in the fall of 2016 in the American West (Grand Canyon, etc.) with a small rental van from <a href="https://www.escapecampervans.com" target="_blank">Escape CamperVans</a> was the main early [trigger](intro-inception.html) for this project.

Enjoy!
