Shopping for parts and material has not always been easy.

Local hardware store
--------------------

To some extent, the interior of a camper van is similar to a house, and in many cases regular building material was used and was purchased at the local hardware store close to where we live, Réno Dépôt. We often shop at Réno Dépôt and particularly appreciate their easy no-questions-asked return policy, even if the purchase has been made more than 3 months ago and even if you do not have your invoice (in which case they give you a credit note). 

Examples of regular building materials we purchased at Réno Dépôt include:

- Insulation panels
- Construction and spray adhesives
- Lumbers
- Plywood
- Fasteners
- Various hardware items such as angle brackets
- 120 V electrical supplies 

Local electronic supply store
-----------------------------

Most small electronic and 12 V components can easily be purchased at the online giants, but in many cases, we wanted to "see and touch" before purchasing. <a href="http://www.kge.ca" target="_blank">King George Électronique</a> on the south shore of Montreal was a convenient place for such purchases, and in most cases, the prices are OK (compared to online purchases).

Such items include:

- 12 V switches
- Small relays
- Shrink tube
- Small enclosures

Low gauge cables
----------------

Low gauge cables (we used 4 AWG and 000 AWG) is heavy and expensive to ship. Réno Dépôt do not have such cables. Maybe they do have 4 AWG, but not the highly flexible multistrand type.

We purchased these cables at <a href="http://www.dorvalec.com" target="_blank">Dorvalec</a> an industrial cable vendor. They would generally not sell small quantities to individuals, but Jacques Lafontaine was very helpful and agreed to sell us what we need by making the purchased from my small company. 

Plusnuts and rivnuts
--------------------

We used some <a href="http://www.cardinalcomponents.com/plusnut.html" target="_blank">plusnuts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet_nut" target="_blank">rivnuts</a> in our build. It is possible to find such items on Amazon or eBay, but we ended up purchasing them online from <a href="http://www.tec-n-tec.com" target="_blank">Tec-N-Tec</a>. It ended up being overall cheaper for us. 

Refrigerator, solar panels and batteries
----------------------------------------

These are heavy and large items which are costly to ship. And these are not items your find at regular stores. But in our online search sessions, we stumbled upon <a href="https://refrigaz.com" target="blank">Solution Réfrigaz</a> which are not too far from Montreal (about 1 hour drive each way) and sell and install RV refrigeration and electrical components at good prices.

We bought our refrigerator, solar panels and batteries there and Martin was very helpful.

Current-limiting power supply
-----------------------------

In our build, we used a current limiting power supply to charge the batteries while connected to the grid. Such power supplies are not run-of-the mill-items.

We purchased ours online at <a href="https://ca.mouser.com" target="_blank">Mouser Electronics</a>.

All the rest: Amazon and eBay vendors
-------------------------------------

The rest of our needed parts and material were purchased on <a href="https://www.amazon.ca" target="_blank">Amazon<a> and <a href="https://www.ebay.ca" target="_blank">eBay</a>, the kings of online shopping.  

These include:

- Inverter
- Solar charge controler
- Toilet
- Switches
