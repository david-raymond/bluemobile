By inner wrapping we essentially refer to what is hidden from view behind the finishing panels.

Soundproofing {#soundproofing}
-------------

We learned on the Internet that soundproofing can essentially be done by reducing the emission or the transmission of undesirable sounds, or both. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundproofing" target="_blank">soundproofing on Wikipedia</a>.

### Preventing noise emission with a roof waterproofing membrane

Preventing the emission of road and wind noise can be done by dampening the vibration of vehicle metal panels. This can be done by making the panels heavy. Vehicle manufacturers use this technique. I recall having seen black plastic or rubber membrane glued to metal panels in the trunk of vehicles, underneath the fabric.

Soundproofing products are available on the market such as <a href="http://www.dynamat.com/brands/dynamat-xtreme/" target="_blank">Dynamat</a>. But they are quite expensive.

We read that some people successfully use roof flashing membrane as a low-cost alternative to dedicated soundproofing products. For example:

We went to our local renovation center and bought this:

{% include image.html file="ResistoBasicWaterproofingMembrane.png" url="https://www.resisto.ca/product/basic-waterproofing-membrane/" caption="Resisto basic waterproofing membrance" %}

Being somewhat worried about the fact that this product, like other roof waterproofing products, is bitumen-based, we checked with the manufacturer who confirmed that the membrane should not emit any smell or gas. However, they did warn that if installed vertically or on a ceiling it must be mechanically fastened, but that given that it will be covered with other material, it should not be a problem.

This somewhat worried us as not all membrane pieces would be fully restrained by other material, such as in recessed sections of the ceiling. When hot, the membrane becomes very soft and gluey and we were afraid it could detach from the metal surface. To be sure, we made tests by:

- Cutting a small section of the membrane (about 1/2 ft<sup>2</sup>)
- Gluing it to a metal sheet (with its self-adhesive backing)
- Positioning the metal sheet vertically
- Heating up the whole thing for full day with an halogen workshop light
- Start over by putting the metal sheet horizontally (so that the membrane is underneath)

The membrane did not move a bit and remained firmly glued to the metal sheet. So no worries.

### MLV

To reduce the transmission of noise, a good product is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_transmission_class#Sound_damping_techniques" target="_blank">MLV</a> (mass-loaded vinyl), which is essentially a heavy mat that is generally simply layed down on a relatively flat surface as part of the subfloor. Being heavy, sound transmission through the mat is reduced.

We did not use MLV since we could not find a local store which had such a product, and being heavy, ordering it online would have incurred high shipping charges. We figured the Resisto membrane together with the other layers of the inner wrapping would be good enough.

### Other soundproofing fiber-based products

In a camper van, some fiber-based soundproofing products could also be used. We have seen a demo box at our local renovation center which was soundproofed with some kind of wool such as <a href="https://www.rockwool.com/products/safensound/" target="_blank">Rockwool Safe'n'Sound</a> with a boombox playing loud music inside the box. The soundproofing was pretty impressive as very little noise was coming out of the demo box.

But we are worried that fiber-based products are not a good fit for a camper van environment where moisture from condensation can get trapped and cause problems. We therefore did not use any fiber-based products in our build, whether for soundproofing or insulation.
 
### Installing the Resisto membrane

So the only soundproofing material we used is the Resisto roof waterproofing membrane.

We cut various pieces of the membrane and glued them on all interior metal surfaces. We did not cover the entirety of the various sections as we wanted the insulation materials (see [below](#insulation-boards)) to be glued to the metal and not to the membrane.

Here are some pictures of the Resisto membrane installed:

{% include image.html file="ResistoMembraneOnWall.jpg" caption="Resisto membrane on wall" %}
{% include image.html file="ResistoMembraneOnCeiling.jpg" caption="Resisto membrane on ceiling" %}

Note that on the ceiling, the membrane was installed only in the outer recessed sections, leaving the inner metal sections exposed to allow gluing the insulation boards.

We learned while installing the membrane that the self adhesive backing does not work well when cold. So:

- We ensured the metal surfaces to which it needed to be glued were not too cold (exposed to the sun; see [build during winter](intro-build-during-winter.html))
- We heated the membrane pieces (with a hair dryer or by putting them on top of the temporary baseboard heater) before gluing them
- Of course, we also ensured the metal surfaces were clean and dry; we used acetone to clean them before gluing the Resisto membrane
- Once installed, we pressed firmly on all the area of the membrane with our fingers and or a small paint roller to ensure proper adherence throughout 

One side effect of using such a membrane is that is seals the metal surface to which it is glued. If condensation forms, it will at least not affect the parts of the metal surfaces where the membrane is installed, therefore avoiding corrosion. 

We are not entirely sure of the effectiveness of this soundproofing solution. It does not look very heavy and knocking on metal panels with and without a membrane does not seem to show a significant difference. But it certainly has some effect, does not do any harm, and is much less expensive than dedicated soundproofing products, which may not necessarily be better (we do not know). Maybe installing 2 layers of it would do a better job, but that is not what we did.

Insulation boards {#insulation-boards}
-----------------

Heating the inside of the camper van will be done with a small 1500 W [portable electric heater](intro-high-level-design-choices.html#portable-electric-heater). If such an electric heater is to be able to keep the inside of the camper comfortable during chilly nights, generated heat needs to be kept inside.

Metal is a pretty good heat conductor so a bare commercial van has a very poor heat retention capacity. We actually verified this when working in the van during [cold winter days](intro-build-during-winter.html), where the temporary baseboard heater we installed was not able to keep the inside warm.

Of course, the inside of the van will be finished with panels and cabinets which help retain heat inside. But we believe (as most do) panels and cabinets are not sufficient. Insulation materials have to be used.

We extensively browsed the Internet in search for ideas about how to go about insulating our van.

We found this article about insulation informative: <a href="https://vanlife.academy/spray-foam-van-insulation-reflectix/" target="_blank">https://vanlife.academy/spray-foam-van-insulation-reflectix/</a>.

We believe that without regard to price, the best approach is probably to have the van walls and ceiling professionally insulated with spray foam. The main advantages are:

- Completely airtight
- Condensation cannot occur on metal panels

But this adds significant costs to the build.

<a href="http://www.buildagreenrv.com/design-and-build-information-for-camper-vans/install-insulation/" target="_blank">This guy</a> went the DIY way and did a good job. But he concedes the process is messy and there are risks of warping the sheet metal.

We went with the insulation board solution, which the link above also describes.

We used 1" blue XPS boards, despite the warning about them being not as heat resistant as polysiocyanurate (we did not find polysiocyanurate boards at our local renovation center and basically took a chance).

{% include image.html file="XpsInsulationBoard.jpg" caption="XPS insulation board" %}

Cardboard templates were cut for the various irregular-shaped sections of the van walls and insulation board pieces were in turn cut using these templates.

In most cases the insulation boards are glued to the van metal panels with construction adhesive spots mostly at the corners. We used what we thought seemed to be the strongest adhesive available at our local renovation center:

{% include image.html file="LepageHeavyDutyConstructionAdhesive.jpg" caption="Lepage heavy duty construction adhesive" %}

The [soundproofing](#soundproofing) membrane pieces are glued to the metal panels just under the boards and are smaller so that the board are glued to exposed metal. 

{% include image.html file="FirstLayerInsulationBoards.jpg" caption="First layer of insulation boards" %}

For the ceiling, the insulation boards are glued with spray adhesive since the soundproofing membrane is recessed in the outer sections of ceiling and the boards have direct contact with the inner metal sections.

Since we used construction adhesive spots to glue the insulation boards and since there is a gap between the boards and the outer recessed sections of the ceiling, we used [spray foam](#spray-foam) around the edges of the first layer of boards, between all the boards and the van metal panels, in order to prevent moisture from getting between the boards and the metal panels.

{% include image.html file="SprayFoamAroundEdgesOfInsulationBoards.jpg" caption="Spray foam around edges of insulation boards.jpg" %}

For the walls and ceiling, we actually used 2 layers of insulation boards, making a total thickness of 2", which happens to leave just enough room for the [reflective bubble wrap](#reflective-bubble-wrap) and the required gap before the rough plywood panels and ceiling panels. The 2<sup>nd</sup> layer of insulation boards was glued to the first one using construction adhesive spots.

{% include image.html file="SecondLayerInsulationBoards.jpg" caption="Second layer of insulation boards" %}

For the [subfloor](#subfloor), in between the lumbers, we used one layer of 1" insulation boards plus an additional 1/2" board of a different type (our renovation center did not have 1/2" boards of the same type) to get a total thickness of 1 1/2", the same as the thickness of the lumbers so that the floor plywood lays flat on the lumbers and insulation boards. We did not glue the insulation panels to the floor.

This is the spray adhesive we bought:

{% include image.html file="LepageHeavyDutySprayAdhesive.jpg" caption="Lepage heavy duty spray adhesive" %}

This adhesive is not good for XPS and although it worked reasonably well on the ceiling for gluing directly to the metal, it did not work for gluing XPS to XPS as it melts XPS making it recess and prevent the two surfaces from properly making contact with each other. We did not bother replacing it with an XPS-compatible product and used construction adhesive inbetween XPS board layers instead.

While working on the camper van, we were satisfied by the fact that the insulation seemed effective because while we were heating ourselves in the van while working (during the [winter](intro-build-during-winter.html)), snow melted much faster on the front part of the roof under which no insulation boards were installed (because the ceiling fan has to be installed first). This means that the heat inside the van escaped much faster trough uninsulated parts of the ceiling, therefore prooving the effectiveness of the insulation on the rest of the ceiling.

Note that the empty spaces behind the structural metal beams, and in some other recessed areas such as behind the wheel wells, have not been insulated. See [spray foam](#spray-foam) and [dealing with potential condensation](#dealing-with-potential-condensation) for more information.

Spray foam {#spray-foam}
----------

As mentioned in [this section](#insulation-boards), we used spray foam to seal the gap between the edges of the insulation boards and the van metal panels. We used this product because is has minimal expansion:

{% include image.html file="TouchNFoamSprayFoam.jpg" caption="Touch'n Foam Spray Foam" %}

This is only to prevent moisture from getting between the insulation boards and the metal panels since the [soundproofing](#soundproofing) membrane pieces create a gap between the boards and the metal panels. If it had not been for this gap, we would probably have glued the boards using spray adhesive instead of thicker construction adhesive and avoided the use of spray foam.

Spray foam is messy to apply. It is not really a spray and it does not hold in place unless the stuff is applied when the tip of the straw is really close to the material on which it is applied, and if it is applied in a gap or crack, or at least between materials forming a 90&deg; andle. Do wear gloves. 

Also, spray foam is hard to apply in hard-to-reach areas. Even if the straw can easily be inserted between a structural metal beam and the insulation board, its tip cannot easily be oriented toward the gap or 90&deg; angle formed by two materials. We had to improvise and build a tool to help with a piece of electrical wire fish tape attached to the tip of the straw so that it can be oriented with one hand while the other squeezes the trigger.
 
{% include image.html file="ToolForApplyingSprayFoamInHardToReachAreas.jpg" caption="Tool for applying spray foam in hard-to-reach areas" %}

Note that foam has not been sprayed within structural metal beams. It was tempting to do so since the bare metal areas behind these beams are blatant defects in the insulation layer. But as said above, spray foam is not really a spray and would not have completely filled the voids and covered the metal panels, potentially inviting and trapping moisture from condensation.

And even then, not all areas behind structural metal beams should be filled. Some of these areas contain wires and provide access to replaceable components such as tail lights.

Maybe if spray foam insulation had been done professionally by a specialized company, we would have asked to completely filled many of these areas behing structural beams. By it was not, so we left these areas uninsulated.

We believe these empty beams will allow some air circulation to avoid long term moisture accumulation from condensation and that it will reduce the risk of corrosion.
