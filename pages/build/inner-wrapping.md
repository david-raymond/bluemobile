By inner wrapping we essentially refer to what will is hidden from view behind the finishing panels.

Soundproofing
-------------

We learned on the Internet that soundproofing can be done by reducing the emission or the transmission of undesirable sounds, or both.

### Preventing noise emission with a roof waterproofing membrane

Preventing the emission of road and wind noise can be done by dampening the vibration of vehicle metal panels. This can be done by making the panels heavy. Vehicle Manufacturers use this technique. I recall having seen black plastic or rubber membrane glued to metal panels in the trunk of vehicles, underneath the frabric.

Soundproofing products are available on the market such as <a href="http://www.dynamat.com/brands/dynamat-xtreme/" target="_blank">Dynamat</a>. But they are quite expensive.

We read that some people successfully use roof flashing membrane as a low-cost alternative to dedicated soundproofing products. For example:

We went to our local renovation center and bought this:

{% include image.html file="ResistoBasicWaterproofingMembrane.png" url="https://www.resisto.ca/product/basic-waterproofing-membrane/" caption="Resisto basic waterproofing membrance" %}

Being somewhat worried about the fact that this product, like other roof waterproofing products, is bitumen based, we checked with the manufacturer who confirmed that the membrane should not emit any smell or gas. However, they did warn that if installed vertically or on a ceiling it must be mechanically fastened, but that given that it will be covered with other material, it should not be a problem.

But to be sure, we made test by:

- Cutting a small section of it
- Gluing it to a metal sheet (with its self-adhesive backing)
- Positioning the metal sheet vertically
- Heating up the whole thing for full day with an halogen workshop light
- Start over by putting the metal sheet horizontally (so that the membrane is underneath)

The membrane did not move a bit and remained firmly glued to the metal sheet.

### MLV

To reduce the transmission of noise, a good product is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_transmission_class#Sound_damping_techniques" target="_blank">MLV</a> (mass-loaded vinyl), which is essentially a heavy mat that is generally simply layed down on a relatively flat surface as part of the subfloor. Being heavy, sound transmission through the mat is reduced.

We did not use MLV since we could not find a local store which had such a product, and being heavy, ordering it online would have incurred high shipping charges. We figured the Resisto membrane together with the other layers of the inner wrapping would be good enough.

### Other soundproofing fiber-based products

In a camper van, some fiber-baed soundproofing products could also be used. We have seen a demo box at our local renovation center which was soundproofed with some kind of wool such as <a href="https://www.rockwool.com/products/safensound/" target="_blank">Rockwool Safe'n'Sound</a> with a boombox playing loud music inside the box. The soundproofing was pretty impressive.

But we are worried that fiber-based products are not a good fit for a camper van environment where moisture from condensation can get trapped and cause problems. We therefore did not use any fiber-based products in our build.
 
### Installing the Resisto membrane

So the only soundproofing material we used is the Resisto roof waterproofing membrane.

We cut various pieces of the membrane and glued them on all interior metal surfaces. We did not cover the entirety of the various sections as we wanted the insulation materials (see below) to be glued to the metal and not to the membrane.

Here are some pictures of the Resisto membrane installed:

{% include image.html file="ResistoMembraneOnWall.jpg" caption="Resisto membrane on wall" %}
{% include image.html file="ResistoMembraneOnCeiling.jpg" caption="Resisto membrane on ceiling" %}

Note that on the ceiling, the membrane was installed only in the outer recessed sections, leaving the inner metal sections exposed to allow glueing the insulation panels.

We are not entirely sure of the effectiveness of this soundproofing solution. It does not look very heavy and knocking on metal panels with and without a membrane does seem to show a significant difference. But it certainly has some effect, does not do any harm, and is much less expensive than dedicated soundproofing products, which may not be better (we do not know). Maybe installing 2 layers of it would do a better job, but that is not what we did.
